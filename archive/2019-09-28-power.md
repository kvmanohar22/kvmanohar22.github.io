This post breaks down the detailed power consumption of quadrotor that I am building to estimate the flight time and plan the purchase of batteries accordingly.

Power consumption parts of our drone include;

- Pixhawk flight controller (mRo pixhawk 2.4.8)
- Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)
- Motors (T Motor Navigator MN2212 V2.0 920KV)
- Onboard computer (Jetson Nano in our case)
- Camera (2 x mvBlueFOX-MLC200wC)
