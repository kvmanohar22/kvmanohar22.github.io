This post is closely related to my Research Internship experience. I spent 3 wonderful months at Preferred Networks Robotics Team working on Computer Vision in Tokyo, Japan. Albeit not a technical post, I want to share my experience. For a more technical report on the work that I did, you can refer [here]() and [here]().
