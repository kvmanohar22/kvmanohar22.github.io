Over the past couples of months I have been exploring the field of 3D reconstruction. This post is dedicated to give a brief overview of the field. This broadly outlies the following topics:

- [How a camera works](#cam)
- [Image Stitching](#stitch)
- [Panorama Generation](#pan)
- [Structure from Motion](#sfm)
- [Point Cloud generation](#point_cloud)
- [Optical Flow](#optical_flow)
- [Single View 3D Reconstruction](#single_view)
